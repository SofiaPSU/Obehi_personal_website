    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div id="Biography" >
      
    <p>Hi I am a Computer Science major at Georgia State University. While learning how to code I was tasked to complete
        a Tic Tac Toe as my final project for a class. It was really rewarding to see the project completed after applying 
        the coding knowledge I had learned during class!
        During my free time I enjoy traveling, ice skating, eating different cultural foods, shopping, and reading articles about fashion and makeup. I have traveled to 
        many different places including London, Nigeria, New York, Florida, and Savannah Georgia.
        A fun story that happened to me while traveling is that I was almost left in Canada while waiting in a plane to go to 
        Georgia. The lights in the airplane were malfunctioning and it took a long time for mechanics to fix the problem. Therefore,
        the airline gave passengers a choice to go to a hotel for the night and fly in another plane the next day, but I decided to wait it
        out. This resulted in me having extra leg room and an empty seat beside me while flying to Georgia!
